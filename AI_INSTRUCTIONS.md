# AI Instructions / System Rules 🤖

This file serves as a persistent context for any AI assistant working on this repository.

## 📝 Documentation Maintenance
**Rule**: Always evaluate if `README.md` or other documentation needs updates after making significant changes to the codebase.

-   **When to Update**:
    -   Adding a new service to `docker-compose.yml`.
    -   Changing configuration steps or environment variables.
    -   Marking a roadmap item as complete (e.g., implementing Copyparty).
-   **When NOT to Update**:
    -   Minor bug fixes or refactors that don't change the user experience.
    -   Internal file structure changes that don't affect setup.

## 💡 Project Goals
-   **Local First**: Prioritize self-hosted solutions where possible.
-   **Secure**: Keep secrets out of the repo (`.env`).
-   **Documentation**: Keep it clean and accessible.
