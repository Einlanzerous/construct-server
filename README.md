# Imperial Construct 🏗️
![Deploy to Construct](https://github.com/Einlanzerous/construct-server/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)

Welcome to **Imperial Construct**, a localized Home Operations Center designed to provide AI services, observability, and storage capabilities in a secure, self-hosted environment.

## 🚀 Current Stack

The following services are currently active:

### 🧠 Artificial Intelligence
-   **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)**: Backend for running large language models (LLMs) like Gemma 3 and Llama 3 locally.
-   **[Open WebUI](https://docs.openwebui.com/)**: A beautiful, feature-rich interface for interacting with your local LLMs (similar to ChatGPT).

### 🛡️ Observability
-   **[Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma)**: Self-hosted monitoring tool for services.
-   **[Datadog](https://datadoghq.com)**: Cloud-based monitoring and logging.
-   **[Dozzle](https://dozzle.dev)**: Real-time log viewer for Docker containers.

### 🏠 Dashboard
-   **[Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer)**: A static homepage to access all services from a single dashboard.

### 📂 Storage & File Sharing
-   **[Copyparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty)**: Lightweight file server serving files from the 1TB NVMe drive (`/data`).

### 🗄️ Database
-   **[PostgreSQL 16](https://www.postgresql.org/)**: Shared instance providing isolated databases for application services. Each service gets its own database and user — see [Architecture](#-database-architecture) below.

### 🔧 Application Services
-   **[vox-loop](services/vox-loop/)** *(placeholder)*: Go service with its own `vox_loop` database.
-   **[cook_book](services/cook_book/)** *(placeholder)*: TypeScript/Prisma service with its own `cook_book` database.

### 🎮 Gaming & Remote Play
-   **[Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine)**: High-performance game streaming host for Moonlight.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

-   [x] **[Copyparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty)**: File server capabilities (drag-and-drop uploads, media streaming).
-   [ ] **[Panox](https://panox.io)**: Library Management System for books/games.
-   [ ] **[Strapi](https://strapi.io)**: Headless CMS for the urbanist blog.
-   [ ] **[Plane](https://plane.so)**: Project management for political dashboard.
-   [x] **[n8n](https://n8n.io)**: Workflow automation (The AI Secretary).
-   [ ] **[Betterstack](https://betterstack.com)**: Uptime monitoring and incident alerting.
-   [ ] **[Kourier](https://github.com/Kourier/Kourier)**: Self-hosted modern email client.
-   [ ] **[Rundeck](https://www.rundeck.com)**: Enterprise job scheduler (Potential Semaphore replacement if needed).

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Einlanzerous/construct-server.git
    cd construct-server
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Copy the example file and update it with your secrets (Datadog API Key, Postgres passwords, etc.).
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    nano .env
    ```

3.  **Create the Docker network:**
    The postgres and application services communicate over an external bridge network.
    ```bash
    make network
    ```

4.  **Start the Stack:**
    ```bash
    make up
    # or: docker compose up -d
    ```

5.  **Verify the database** *(optional)*:
    ```bash
    make db-check
    ```

### 🔄 Automation & CI/CD
-   **[Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/)**: Automatically updates running Docker containers (excludes AI stack).
-   **[GitHub Actions Runner](https://github.com/actions/runner)**: Self-hosted runner for deploying changes to this server automatically.
-   **[n8n](https://n8n.io)**: Workflow automation.
-   **[Semaphore UI](https://semaphoreui.com)**: Modern UI for running Ansible playbooks.

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

A single PostgreSQL 16 instance provides logically isolated databases for application services:

| Service | Database | User | Migrations |
|---------|----------|------|------------|
| vox-loop | `vox_loop` | `vox_loop_user` | [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) — run on startup |
| cook_book | `cook_book` | `cook_book_user` | [Prisma Migrate](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate) — `prisma migrate deploy` at entrypoint |

- Databases and users are created automatically by `db/init-db.sql` on first volume initialization.
- Each service owns its own migrations and runs them independently at startup — no init-container needed.
- Postgres is internal-only on the `construct_net` bridge network (no exposed port).
- Existing services (Ollama, Open WebUI, etc.) are **not** on `construct_net` yet — migration is incremental.

### Makefile Targets

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make network` | Create the `construct_net` Docker bridge network |
| `make up` | Create network + start full stack |
| `make down` | Stop full stack |
| `make db-up` | Start only the postgres service |
| `make db-shell` | Open a psql shell to postgres |
| `make db-check` | Verify databases and user access |
